      Hi friends! My name is Alina and I’m super excited to be this year’s
      ECSESS President. I’m currently in my fourth year of Computer Engineering
      and this is my third year on ECSESS and I hope you are looking forward to
      the events we have planned this year. Some of my main goals this year are
      to: improve council’s transparency, make our resources more available to
      ECSE students and increase our accountability to the ECSE student body. If
      you have any ideas or concerns I’m always down to have a chat, you can
      find me chilling on Trottier 5th or in the ECSESS Lounge (Trottier 1060).

      I’m Erick, and I try my best to keep the student body informed on what’s
      happening around ECSESS. My job consists of sending out the Livewire,
      making posters, handling social media, and updating the website (it’ll
      look better soon, I promise). Please read my newsletters. Please?
