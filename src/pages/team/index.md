      **Education:** Ph.D. in Experimental Medicine, McGill University


      **Current research:** Due to lack of effective therapeutic markers, triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) shows poor prognosis. These cancers are
      enriched in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), allowing for tumor relapse,
      metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. I have previously found that
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) played an important role in regulating BCSC
      self-renewal and expansion. My current research focuses on further
      investigating the role of COX-2 and its associated genes in BCSC-mediated
      tumor metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.

      Montréal.

      * **Current research :** I am currently working on evaluating the
      therapeutic potential of a certain TGFb-mediated microRNA found to be
      upregulated in triple negative breast cancer. This is being tested in
      vitro as well as in vivo using CRISPR/Cas technology.
