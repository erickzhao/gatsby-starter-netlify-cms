      **Education:** Ph.D. in Experimental Medicine, McGill University


      **Current research:** Due to lack of effective therapeutic markers, triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) shows poor prognosis. These cancers are
      enriched in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), allowing for tumor relapse,
      metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. The current research focuses on
      further investigating the role of COX-2 and its associated genes in
      BCSC-mediated tumor metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.

      * **Current research :** Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of a
      certain TGFb-mediated microRNA found to be upregulated in triple negative
      breast cancer. This is being tested in vitro as well as in vivo using
      CRISPR/Cas technology.

      * **Education **: PhD.

      * **Current research **:** **My research focuses on pre-clinic experiments
      to investigate human cancerous processes and mechanisms by using
      immunodeficient laboratory mouse models (breast cancer, pancreas cancer,
      lung and liver metastases, etc.) in order to explore and develop novel
      therapies for cancer treatment.
