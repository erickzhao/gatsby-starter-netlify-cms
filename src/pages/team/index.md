      * **Current research :** Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of a
      certain TGFb-mediated microRNA found to be upregulated in triple negative
      breast cancer. This is being tested in vitro as well as in vivo using
      CRISPR/Cas technology.

      * **Education **: PhD in Organic Chemistry, University of Normandie,
      France.

      * **Current research :** Triple negative breast cancer is the most
      aggressive breast cancer subtype. While targeted therapies exist for the
      hormone receptor-positive breast cancer subtypes, there are no approved
      targeted treatments for TNBC. Following surgery, chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy remain the only options for treatment of TNBC. My project
      aims at developing novel potent CDK4 inhibitory compounds that can
      effectively target and eliminate CSCs likely to be therapeutically
      beneficial and may provide rationale for using a new type of targeted
      therapy in TNBCs patients

      * **Education **: PhD.

      * **Current research **: My research focuses on pre-clinic experiments to
      investigate human cancerous processes and mechanisms by using
      immunodeficient laboratory mouse models (breast cancer, pancreas cancer,
      lung and liver metastases, etc.) in order to explore and develop novel
      therapies for cancer treatment.
