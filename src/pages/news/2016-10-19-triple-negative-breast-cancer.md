title: New marker and potential therapy for triple negative breast cancer
date: 2016-10-19T15:04:10.000Z
description: >-
  Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast
  cancer, found in 15-20% of all cases. These breast tumors are enriched in a
  rare population of cancer cells, called cancer stem cells, which are
  responsible for the high rates of metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy and
  tumor recurrence. There are very few biomarkers for this cancer type and,
  there are no proven treatment options to combat it.

  New hope is on the horizon, thanks in part to research led by senior author
  Dr. Jean-Jacques Lebrun, Professor of Medicine at the McGill University

  Health Centre Cancer Research Program. In the study, published in 

  Nature Scientific Reports, Dr. Lebrun, working with McGill colleagues Dr.
  Suhad Ali and Dr. Meiou Dai, found that the expression of cyclin-dependent
  kinase(CDK4)gene was higher in breast cancer tumours when compared to

  normal tissues, and was at the highest level in aggressive tumours of the

  TNBC subtype. They also identified CDK4 to serve as a potential

  therapeutic target to combat TNBC tumors.
