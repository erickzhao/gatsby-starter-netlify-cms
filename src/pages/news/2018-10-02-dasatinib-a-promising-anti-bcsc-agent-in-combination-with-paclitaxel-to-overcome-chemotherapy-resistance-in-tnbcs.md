  Dasatinib enhances the effects of paclitaxel on chemotherapy-resistant breast
  cancer through targeting breast cancer stem cells.

We identified Dasatinib, a Src kinase family inhibitor, potently reduced BCSC self-renewal and two BCSC populations (ALDH+ and CD24lowCD44high) as well as phosphor-Src. We also demonstrated dasatinib to block pac-induced BCSC enrichment and Src activation in the parental TNBC cells. Interestingly, we found that dasatinib induced an epithelial differentiation of pac-resistant cells, resulting in their enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel.
