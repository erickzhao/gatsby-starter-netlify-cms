We identified Dasatinib, a Src kinase family inhibitor, potently reduced BCSC self-renewal and two BCSC populations (ALDH+ and CD24lowCD44high) as well as phosphor-Src. We also demonstrated Dasatinib to block pac-induced BCSC enrichment and Src activation in the parental TNBC cells. Interestingly, we found that Dasatinib induced an epithelial differentiation of pac-resistant cells, resulting in their enhanced sensitivity to Paclitaxel.
