# About the Lebrun Lab

Based in Montréal, Canada, the Lebrun Lab is part of the Research Institute of McGill University Health center.

Dr Lebrun’s research program aims at understanding processes underlying tumor suppression, cancer stemness, drug resistance, metastasis and tumor relapse, all considered major challenges in the management of cancer patients.

The MUHC-RI Hospital offers a state of the art research institute equipped with powerful biomedical instruments. The MUHC is an internationally recognized biomedical and healthcare hospital research center, with over 500 researchers, 1,000 graduate and postdoctoral students. The MUHC-RI is a unique medical and life sciences research facility in Canada, equipped with state-of-the-art technologies, cutting-edge core facilities (imaging, flow cytometry) and proteomic core unit for MS. The ultra-modern vivarium and associated staff is fully-ready for all surgical procedures and bio-imaging analysis.

Dasatinib, a Promising Anti-BCSC Agent in Combination with Paclitaxel to Overcome Chemotherapy Resistance in TNBCs.

We identified Dasatinib, a Src kinase family inhibitor, potently reduced BCSC self-renewal and two BCSC populations (ALDH+ and CD24lowCD44high) as well as phosphor-Src. We also demonstrated Dasatinib to block pac-induced BCSC enrichment and Src activation in the parental TNBC cells. Interestingly, we found that Dasatinib induced an epithelial differentiation of pac-resistant cells, resulting in their enhanced sensitivity to Paclitaxel.
