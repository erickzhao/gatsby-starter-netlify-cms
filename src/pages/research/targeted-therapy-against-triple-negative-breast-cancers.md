Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of mortality. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of receptors for estrogen and progesterone as well as lack of HER-2 gene. These tumors are enriched in cancer stems cells and exhibit resistance to most treatments and chemotherapy. TNBC is more prevalent in younger females and accounts for about 10% to 20% of breast cancer incidence with poor prognosis.**_ Importantly, to date, no efficient therapy exists for this type of cancer._** Hence it is crucial to define new treatment options for these patients with deadly metastatic diseases.

We are working on the design and development of small inhibitor compounds targeting CDK4 and Cox-2, based on their therapeutic value against cancer stem cells and chemotherapy-resistant cells in TNBCs. These new small molecules are tested in a variety of in vitro assays but also in vivo, using preclinical xenograft transplantation models of TNBCs. A second aspect of the project is dedicated to the development of new therapeutic approaches specifically targeting cancer stem cells, using combi-molecules that will target both CDK4 and Cox2.
