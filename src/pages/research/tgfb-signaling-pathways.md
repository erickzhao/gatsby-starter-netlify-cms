Our various projects are based on the dual role of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) in cancer. TGFβ exerts tumour suppressive effects in normal cells and in early carcinomas, whereas in advanced cancer it exerts pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects. Therefore, we have developed two lines of research: 1) defining the tumour suppressive role of TGFβ – how this growth factor inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and prevents cell immortalisation in normal cells and early carcinomas; and 2) defining the pro-metastatic effect of this cytokine in invasive cancers, focusing on breast cancer with the goal of designing novel anti-TGFβ signalling therapies.
