We have developed high throughput genome wide CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function approaches to characterize key genes that regulate fundamental cancer processes, including primary tumor growth, tumor metastasis, cancer stemness and resistance to chemotherapy, using pre-clinical mice models. Using these genome-wide forward-genetics approaches, we will extend the scope of our studies and address long-standing challenging questions related to the breast cancer cell origin (i.e. identify specific genetic changes driving malignant transformation of normal cells and tumor development).
