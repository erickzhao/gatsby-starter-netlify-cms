We identified microRNAs that regulate tumor suppression and progression and could efficiently reduce tumor growth in vivo, by modulating expression of these miRNAs, using preclinical Xenograft breast cancer models. We are investigating their clinical prognostic and therapeutic values in different models of solid tumors (breast, pancreatic, prostate, melanoma, liver and ovarian cancers).
